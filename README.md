# Basic-Calculator
Objective:
Build a basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division while handling potential errors like invalid inputs or division by zero. This will help you practice functions, conditionals, error handling, and user input.
Requirements:
1.Calculator Functions:
Implement four functions to handle the basic operations:
▪Addition (add()).
▪Subtraction (subtract()).
▪Multiplication (multiply()).
▪Division (divide()).
2.User Input:
Ask the user to input:
▪Two numbers.
▪The operation they want to perform (+, -, *, /).
3.Error Handling:
Handle invalid inputs (e.g., if the user inputs a string instead of a number).
Handle division by zero by displaying an appropriate error message.
4.User Menu:
Create a simple menu that allows the user to:
▪Perform a calculation.
▪Exit the program.
Bonus (Optional):
•Implement a power function (e.g., 2^3).
•Allow the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.
